# Motivation #

A range of scripts used for building documentation, interaction with docker and so on is identical for majority of 
implemented projects. This repository is intended to be a holder for such scripts. It can be easily referenced as a git sub module:

    #!shell
    $ git submodule add https://lukaszlaszko@bitbucket.org/lukaszlaszko/scripts.git scripts

# Scripts #

Following scripts have been defined in this repository:

* docs - automating doc comments to human readable documentation conversion.
    + [build_docs.sh](https://bitbucket.org/lukaszlaszko/scripts/raw/HEAD/docs/build_docs.sh)

        Runs doxygen with configuration from **docs/doxygen.cfg** and saves reasults to a given directory:

            #!shell
            $ docs/build_docs.sh -t bin_docs

        The script automatically detects repository root directory, name, current branch and latest tags in order
    to place generated documentation in a proper output directory and supplement it with version information. 

    + [push_docs.sh](https://bitbucket.org/lukaszlaszko/scripts/raw/HEAD/docs/push_docs.sh)

        Pushes documentation generated with *build_docs.sh* into a git repository.

            #!shell
            $ docs/push_docs.sh -c -r git@bitbucket.org:lukaszlaszko/lukaszlaszko.bitbucket.org.git -d bin_docs/* 

        Initially developed to support publication of autogenerated documentation from [bitbucket pipelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/bitbucket-pipelines-792496469.html) into bitbucket 
    [cloud based website](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html).
